# 0x02. C - Functions,nested loops

In this project we look deeper into loops and start to explore functions. Nested loops allow us to iterate through multiple layers in our problems and allow us to create far more sophisticated programs.

## Concepts:

This project focusses on the following concepts:

 - Functions
 - Nested loops

## Resources:

I have found the following resources to be particularly useful for this project (as well as the concepts listed in the section above):

 - [Nested while loops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3iGeQ1gIss)
 - [C - Functions](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_functions.htm)
 - [Learning to Program in C (Part 06) (stop at 14:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMlnFwYdqIw)
 - [What is the purpose of a function prototype?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-purpose-of-a-function-prototype/)
 - [C - Header Files (stop before the “Once-Only Headers” paragraph)](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_header_files.htm)

## Tasks:

The following is a breakdown of all of the tasks for this project. The actual instructions for each task can be found on the relevant project page on the ALX SE Intranet, however, sharing that information is prohibited. I have therefore given a brief description of what each entails, what the code does and in some cases, I have included some extra information for context and learning (particularly the more advanced topics).

### Task 7 - There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important

[7-print_last_digit.c](https://github.com/deanbirnie/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/7-print_last_digit.c)

Overview:

Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

### Task 8 - I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life

### Task 15 - Even Liber Abbaci

[103-fibonacci.c](https://github.com/deanbirnie/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/103-fibonacci.c)

Overview:

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89. By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, write a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms, followed by a new line.

### Task 16 - In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A+

[104-fibonacci.c](https://github.com/deanbirnie/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/104-fibonacci.c)
