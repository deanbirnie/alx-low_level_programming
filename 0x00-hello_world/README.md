# Project: 0x00 C - Hello World!

This project covers the intro to programming in C. We learn the basic structure of a C file and are exposed to the standard library, the GCC Compiler and the Betty code standard for the first time.

## Concepts:

This project focusses on the following concepts:

 - Introduction to C Programming

## Resources:

I have found the following resources to be particularly useful for this project (as well as the concepts listed in the section above):

## Tasks:

The following is a breakdown of all of the tasks for this project. The actual instructions for each task can be found on the relevant project page on the ALX SE Intranet, however, sharing that information is prohibited. I have therefore given a brief description of what each entails, what the code does and in some cases, I have included some extra information for context and learning (particularly the more advanced topics).


### Task 0 - Preprocessor
[0-preprocessor](https://github.com/deanbirnie/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor)
Overview:
Here we start learning about the different stages within the compilation process. In this task we must write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the output to a new file.

### Task 1 - Compiler
[1-compiler](https://github.com/deanbirnie/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler)
Overview:
In this task we must write a script compiles a .c file but does not link it. The output file will be named the same as the .c file except with the .o extension.

### Task 2 - Assembler
[2-assembler](https://github.com/deanbirnie/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler)
Overview:
This task requires us to generate the assembly code from C source code and save the output as a .s file.

### Task 3 - Name
[3-name](https://github.com/deanbirnie/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/3-name)
Overview:
Here we compile from a C source file and create an executable nammed "cisfun".

### Task 4 - Hello, puts
[4-puts.c](https://github.com/deanbirnie/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c)
Overview:
This is the start to our C programming journey. Here we are required to print a string to the console specifically using the "puts" function and NOT the "printf" function.

### Task 5 - Hello, printf
[5-printf.c](https://github.com/deanbirnie/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c)
Overview:
Using only the "printf" function, print a string exactly, followed by a new line.

### Task 6 - Size is not grandeur, and teritory does not make a nation.
[6-size.c](https://github.com/deanbirnie/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c)
Overview:
Print to console the sizes of various variable/data types on the computer it is compiled on.

## Advanced Tasks

### Task 7 - Intel
[100-intel]()
Overview:
Write a scriptthat generates assembly code in Intel Syntax of C source code and save the output file with a .s extension.

### Task 8 - UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity.
[101-quote.c]()
Overview:
Printing to standard error with specific requirements and limitations.
