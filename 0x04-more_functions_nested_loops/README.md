# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

Time to get some practice with even more functions and nested loops!

## Concepts:

This project focusses on the following concepts:

 - Functions
 - Nested loops

## Resources:

I have found the following resources to be particularly useful for this project (as well as the concepts listed in the section above):

 - [Nested while loops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3iGeQ1gIss)
 - [C - Functions](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_functions.htm)
 - [Learning to Program in C (Part 06) (stop at 14:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMlnFwYdqIw)
 - [What is the purpose of a function prototype?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-purpose-of-a-function-prototype/)
 - [C - Header Files (stop before the “Once-Only Headers” paragraph)](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_header_files.htm)

## Tasks:

The following is a breakdown of all of the tasks for this project. The actual instructions for each task can be found on the relevant project page on the ALX SE Intranet, however, sharing that information is prohibited. I have therefore given a brief description of what each entails, what the code does and in some cases, I have included some extra information for context and learning (particularly the more advanced topics).

### Task 0 - isupper

[0-isupper.c](https://github.com/deanbirnie/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/0-isupper.c)

Overview:

Write a function that checks for uppercase character.

### Task 1 - isdigit

[1-isdigit.c](https://github.com/deanbirnie/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/1-isdigit.c)

Overview:

Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

### Task 2 - Collaboration is multiplication

[2-mul.c](https://github.com/deanbirnie/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/2-mul.c)

Overview:

Write a function that multiplies two integers.

### Task 3 - The numbers speak for themselves

[3-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/deanbirnie/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/3-print_numbers.c)

Overview:

Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

### Task 4 - I believe in numbers and signs

Overview:

Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

### Task 5 - Numbers constitute the only universal language

[5-more_numbers.c](https://github.com/deanbirnie/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/5-more_numbers.c)

Overview:

Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

### Task 6 - The shortest distance between two points is a straight line

[6-print_line.c](https://github.com/deanbirnie/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/6-print_line.c)

Overview:

Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

### Task 7 - I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe

[7-print_diagonal.c](https://github.com/deanbirnie/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/7-print_diagonal.c)

Overview:

Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

### Task 8 - You are so much sunshine in every square inch

[8-print_square.c](https://github.com/deanbirnie/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/8-print_square.c)

Overview:

Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

### Task 9 - Fizz-Buzz

[9-fizz_buzz.c](https://github.com/deanbirnie/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/9-fizz_buzz.c)

Overview:

The “Fizz-Buzz test” is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can’t seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag.

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

### Task 10 - Triangles

[10-print_triangle.c](https://github.com/deanbirnie/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/10-print_triangle.c)

Overview:

Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

### Advanced Tasks:

### Task 11 - The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic

[100-prime_factor.c]()

Overview:

The prime factors of 1231952 are 2, 2, 2, 2, 37 and 2081.

Write a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.

### Task 12 - Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper

[101-print_number.c]()

Overview:

 - Prototype: void print_number(int n);
 - You can only use _putchar function to print
 - You are not allowed to use long
 - You are not allowed to use arrays or pointers
 - You are not allowed to hard-code special values
