# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

This project is the third on the topic of pointers, arrays and strings. Here we are building on what we have already learned but this time adding a few layers of complexity. We are going to be working with pointers to pointers and multi-dimensional arrays.

## Concepts:

 - Pointers
  - Pointers to pointers
 - Arrays
  - Multi-dimensional arrays

## Resources:

The following resources are either recommended fro this project or are external resources that I have found to be particularly helpful.

 - [Pointer to pointer](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_pointer_to_pointer.htm)
 - [More Pointer to pointers](https://beginnersbook.com/2014/01/c-pointer-to-pointer/)
 - [Multi-dimensional Arrays](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_multi_dimensional_arrays.htm)
 - [2D Arrays](https://beginnersbook.com/2014/01/2d-arrays-in-c-example/)

## Tasks:

The following is a breakdown of all of the tasks for this project. The actual instructions for each task can be found on the relevant project page on the ALX SE Intranet, however, sharing that information is prohibited. I have therefore given a brief description of what each entails, what the code does and in some cases, I have included some extra information for context and learning (particularly the more advanced topics).

### Task 0 - Memset
[0-memset.c]()
Overview:
Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte.
