# 0x01. C - Variables; if, else, while

In this project, we explore variables in C, conditional statements using `if` as well as loops using `while` specifically.

## Concepts:

This project focusses on the following concepts:

 - Variables
 - if/else conditional statements
 - while loops

## Resources:

I have found the following resources to be particularly useful for this project (as well as the concepts listed in the section above):

## Tasks:

The following is a breakdown of all of the tasks for this project. The actual instructions for each task can be found on the relevant project page on the ALX SE Intranet, however, sharing that information is prohibited. I have therefore given a brief description of what each entails, what the code does and in some cases, I have included some extra information for context and learning (particularly the more advanced topics).

### Task 0 - Positive anything is better than negative nothing

[0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/deanbirnie/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c)

Overview:

This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.

[Source Code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c)

### Task 1 - The last digit

[1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/deanbirnie/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c)

Overview:

This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.
