# Recursion

This project covers recursion in the context of C programming. Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. In this regard, a recursive function is a function that calls itself.

## Concepts:

This project focusses on the following concepts:

 - Recursion

## Resources:

I have found the following resources to be particularly useful for this project (as well as the concepts listed in the section above):

## Tasks:

The following is a breakdown of all of the tasks for this project. The actual instructions for each task can be found on the relevant project page on the ALX SE Intranet, however, sharing that information is prohibited. I have therefore given a brief description of what each entails, what the code does and in some cases, I have included some extra information for context and learning (particularly the more advanced topics).
