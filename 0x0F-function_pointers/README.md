## Tasks:

The following is a breakdown of all of the tasks for this project. The actual instructions for each task can be found on the relevant project page on the ALX SE Intranet, however, sharing that information is prohibited. I have therefore given a brief description of what each entails, what the code does and in some cases, I have included some extra information for context and learning (particularly the more advanced topics).
